                <h2>History: Adventure from the Past</h2>
                <p>White water rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt 
            to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, 
            the river was found to be too difficult and dangerous, earning it the nickname ‚ÄúMad River.‚Äù</p>
                <p>The first rubber raft was made by Lt. John Fremont and Horace H. Day in the 1840s. Although invented earlier,
             it wasn't until the turn of the century that the first commercial rafting trip took place. On June 9, 1940, 
             Clyde Smith led a successful trip through the Snake River Canyon. In later years, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. 
             constructed a modern resort hotel in Grand Teton National Park, which began offering float trips using surplus war rafts. 
            By the 1960s and 70s, whitewater rafting companies started forming, and the sport gained popularity. -- Google</p>
