            <p>I am a working student who are living alone in the center or Metro Manila. 
                <br> is such a really hard life top begin with but I am still doing what I can to survive alone no matter what. 
                <br> I am currently working as Transaction Database Writer/Admin for React News, a news title of Green Street Advisors UK.</p>
            <p>I have been a member of <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints</a> for about seven years now.
                <br> I am the only member in my family it is also the reason why my family disowned me. 
                <br> Yet, I am still trying to be the best version of myself working in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/manila-philippines-temple?lang=eng">Manila Philippines Temple</a> twice a week.</p>
            <p>As a mental health advocate I want to be more open of what my true challenges right now. 
                <br>I am suffering from depressive disorder and clinical anxiety.</p>
            <p>I am hoping that we can all have best experience this semester.</p>
